# Firewall-Suite
This is a beefy (*70MB*) Python Script that makes a GUI for in place of old confusing Windows Firewall one. It is simple to run (run: Firewall_Suite.exe) and use (designed for a sleek GUI). 

# Issues
This IS infact a *beta* version, and there is a moderate chance errors can and will occur. I would be greatful if you informed me of these!

# Coding
This is NOT MALWARE, while Virus Total shows flagging og Firewall_Suite.exe, it is safe (source code in "CODE HERE" folder: Firewall_Suite.py) Or if you truly don't trust the .exe, use the .py. I don't care.

# To run/get

### First:

1) Download Firewall_Suite.zip in the *realeses* section.

### Second:

2) Unzip Firewall_Suite.zip and go into Firewall Suite and go into "Main (exe here)" and run the .exe (Firewall_Suite.exe)

### Third:

3) Follow instructions, run as admin (**HIGHLY NEEDED**), and continue!
